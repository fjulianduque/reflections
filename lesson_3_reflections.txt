When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  I would use a remote repository for:
    -Keeping it in a central part different that my computer so it could be accesed even from my mobile phone.
    -If I would want to collaborate with others in creating any kind of project
    -As an optional backuo for my projects
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	The idea is to push them when you are really ready and want to do it. When you are really decided to do it.
