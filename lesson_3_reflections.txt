When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  I would use a remote repository for:
    -Keeping it in a central part different that my computer so it could be accesed even from my mobile phone.
    -If I would want to collaborate with others in creating any kind of project
    -As an optional backuo for my projects
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	The idea is to push them when you are really ready and want to do it. When you are really decided to do it.
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
 -Forks: It happens somewhere up in the cloud. It is a clonning within the cloud machines
 -Clones: It happens down in my computer
 -Branches: As its names specifies, it is a new evolving path from a specific point from my masters (up and down)

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	To be up to date with any other changes that could be done from outside o fmy computer 

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
	I guess that without Git/GitHub any kind of tool to track open changes, branches and the master, starting for a common whiteboard or similar...
