What happens when you initialise a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	It prepares the directory so all files changes are tracked

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	It contains only the files to be initially changed. It avoids to make errors or to easily go and look for changes

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
	Adding the files corresponding to the logical change, probably one fiel at atime
